#indentation is very important in python as
# it is used to define the block of code
# if you don't use indentation properly
# then it will give you an error

# for loop
initial_set=set()
for i in range(0,8):
    i=input("Enter the element: ")
    initial_set.add(i)
print(initial_set)

#set stores unique elements and it is unordered and
# unindexed so you can't access the elements using index
# but you can loop through the set
# and you can't change the elements of the set
# but you can add new elements to the set
# and you can remove the elements from the set
